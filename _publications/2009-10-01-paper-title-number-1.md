This paper introduces a two-step convolutional neural network for automated detection of microaneurysms in fundus images, a critical early marker of diabetic retinopathy. The method enhances diagnostic accuracy by combining image processing and deep learning to identify microaneurysm lesions with high sensitivity and specificity.
