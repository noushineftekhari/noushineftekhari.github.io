## Noushin Eftekhari on life aboard the RV Cefas Endeavour, and how plankton monitoring could revolutionise marine research.
This May, I had the unique opportunity to participate in the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) Nephrops Underwater Video Survey (UVS NEP) aboard the [RV Cefas Endeavour](https://www.cefas.co.uk/about-us/facilities/rv-cefas-endeavour/). This eight-day survey, known as CEND 0824, took place from the 16th to the 23rd of May, starting in Lowestoft and concluding in Newcastle.

The primary objective of the survey was to conduct a standard UVS of *Nephrops* burrow densities in the [Farn Deeps](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/highly-protected-marine-areas-north-east-of-farnes-deep) grounds. In total, we aimed to cover 110 primary stations, with additional backup stations available if needed. Beyond this main survey, I had the chance to test our cutting-edge real-time plankton monitoring software, integrated directly into the ship’s systems. Here’s a closer look at how this innovative system operates and its potential impact on marine research.

### Collecting Marine Particle Images with the Plankton Imager

Our primary tool for plankton data collection was the [Plankton Imager](https://www.planktonanalytics.com/) (version Pi-10), a high-speed color line scan imaging instrument. Connected to the clean seawater underway system at a depth of 4 meters, the Pi-10 continuously supplied water at a flow rate of 34 liters per minute, capturing high-resolution (10 µm) RGB images of passing particles within a size range of 180 µm to 3.5 cm.

Images are processed in real-time using an EPIX E8 frame store, which extracts regions of interest and saves them in TIFF format with timestamps and unique identifiers. Raw images are stored in 12-bit resolution and converted to 8-bit for easier viewing and analysis. Given the operational constraints and skewed distribution of plankton, only mesozooplankton (200 µm–2 cm) images are processed and saved.

### Developing a Real-Time Classification Pipeline

Building on previous work from the [Turing Data Study Group project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/data-study-group-final-report-centre-environment-fisheries-and-aquaculture), we developed a real-time classification pipeline to streamline plankton monitoring. Utilizing the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin "Edge-AI" processor, this system categorizes images into counts of copepods, non-copepods, and detritus, using deep learning models.

Data is then transmitted through the ship’s broadband satellite communication to a cloud-hosted [digital dashboard](https://planktonapi-dev.cefastest.co.uk), accessible remotely for analysis. This real-time processing capability not only facilitates immediate classification and data transmission but also enables responsive monitoring efforts.

### Training and Evaluating the Model

The extensive data collected by the Pi-10 during the survey provided a robust dataset for training our classification model. The model’s evaluation occurs in two stages: initial testing against a designated test set to ensure accuracy and reliability, followed by integration into the real-time pipeline for active monitoring.

### Reflections and Future Directions

Testing the real-time plankton monitoring software during the Nephrops survey marked a significant milestone in marine research technology. Real-time classification and analysis of plankton enable faster response times to environmental changes and more efficient data processing. This technology paves the way for advanced monitoring applications across ecosystems, where measured variables can be seen and acted upon in real-time.

### Life at Sea

Living aboard the ship, despite occasional seasickness and the unexpected experience of a real fire alarm, was a unique adventure. Life at sea offered a precise daily routine, collaboration with individuals from diverse backgrounds, and a refreshing break from constant internet access, allowing me to appreciate the beauty of the calm North Sea. I am deeply grateful to the Cefas team, especially James Scott and Sophie Pitois, for their support throughout the survey.
